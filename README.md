# <horiseon-refactor>

## Description

I was given code to refactor and make it more accessible, HTML semantic, and to make the code DRY. Cleaning the code to be HTML semantic, accessible, and DRY helps other coders to be able to easily read the code. Doing this refactor allows users and coders to be able to easily read the code and understand it. I learned to be more efficient with my code and how to read other people's code. It also helped me learn how to be HTML semantic with my code, and to not make repetitive code.
